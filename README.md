## Introduction

AdvDroidZero is an efficient query-based attack framework designed to generate adversarial Android malware under zero knowledge setting.
The primary objective of our study is to assess the robustness of ML-based Android malware detection methods.

Further details can be found in our paper "Efficient Query-Based Attack against ML-Based Android Malware Detection under Zero Knowledge Setting" [[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01866.pdf)], ACM CCS 2023.

If you end up building on this code as part of a project or publication, please include a reference to our paper:
